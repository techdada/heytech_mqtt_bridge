# heytech_mqtt_bridge
MQTT bridge for HeyTech roller shutter / light controllers, using most of the great work of Jey Cee (https://github.com/Jey-Cee/ioBroker.heytech)

To make it useable independently of ioBroker it communicates purely by MQTT instead. So far only the basic functions are tested, so open/close and goto Position of the shutters.
